# Is capillary leak index (CLI) a marker of severity of illness in sepsis?
Study to test if capillary leak index (CLI) is a marker of severity of illness in sepsis.  
 - Sepsis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality.
 - Capillary leak, the escape of protein-rich fluid leaks out of vessels into organs, is an important part of sepsis.
 - CLI can be estimated by the change in hematocrit after IV fluids.
 - Changes in hematocrit would be inversely proportional to the degree of capillary leak.
 
## Null hypothesis
Septic patients with a high CLI will have the same risk for morbidity and mortality as patients with a low CLI.
## Cohort
Patients w/ sepsis (eICU database).

## Exposure
CLI (quartiles of severity).

## Outcome
In-hospital mortality.

## Model
Generalized Additive Model
